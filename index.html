	<p>I started watching and doing the Front End Masters Bootcamp again and we learnt about HTML - creating paragraphs, anchors for links, tags, setting up VS code. I am hoping to this time be able to create and display projects that we build as part of this program.</p>
	
	<p>I had the idea of giving credit to the many sources that helped and helps me with recovery. For example the Huberman podcast, the What's This Tao All About, B.K.S. Iyengar's Light on Yoga, Soma FM, Spotify, so much good music, the good books, Thich Nhat Hanh's The Heart of The Buddha's Teaching, Henry Miller's Oranges, the 7 Habits by Stephen Covey, Julia Cameron's Artist's Way. I am doing the Artist's Way method and I am somewhere at the tenth week and I write three pages every day.</p>
	    
	<p> I am learning from the <a href="https://beta.reactjs.org/">React JS documentation</a> and I am learning to make components, which I also learned at freeCodeCamp, but it is great to refresh the knowledge and make it practicle.</p>
	<p>So for example I can write import { useState } from 'react' function MyButton({count, onClick}) { return ( <button onClick={onClick}>You clicked {count} times.</button> ) } export default function MyApp() { const [count, setCount] = useState(0) function handleClick(){ setCount( count + 1 ) } return ( <><h2>Counter</h2><MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick}><MyButton count={count} onClick={handleClick}></> )}</p>
	<p>this will not work because it requires transpilers like Babel and links to React</p>
	    <h2>Yesterday I learned</h2>
	    <ul>
		    <li>creating a HTML file in VS Code</li>
		    <li>making unordered lists</li>
		    <li>making a header</li>
		    <li>creating an ordered list</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>This is an effort to apply my learning from the Artist's Way creative recovery in webdesigndevelopmentðŸ˜Œ</p>
	    <p>This is a Yoga Nidra podcast I am listening to, and it is really very cool: <a href="https://theyoganidrapodcast.captivate.fm/">The Yoga Nidra Podcast</a> it is from the <a href="https://aatmalife.com/">aatmalife.com</a></p>
	    <p>Great practice and knowledge about dopamine and health practices at <a href="https://hubermanlab.com/welcome-to-the-huberman-lab-podcast/"></p>

      Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
      It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

      Read this section for a production-ready setup with JSX:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html#add-jsx-to-a-project

      In a larger project, you can use an integrated toolchain that includes JSX instead:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

      You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
      https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-jsx.html
